# ðŸ“š My libft - 42 School Project

Welcome to my libft repo ðŸ‘‹

## Description of this project

This was the very first project we carried out as students at 42. This project brings together many small functions already carried out during the swimming pool and others. My version isn't perfect and doesn't have the bonuses ðŸ¤£ (which I strongly recommend doing afterwards). 

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective on the project, it can also be useful.
